<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
A chrome extension for:
						<ul>
							<li>
								women + non-binary => that suggests you a stronger, and much more confident lingo that
								makes you aware of how subconsciously you're trying to undermine yourself through your
								words.
							</li>
							<li>
								men => that suggests you a softer, much more inclusive lingo, so you do not offend any
								community member
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li><br />
					<li>
						An onsite speech-to-text facility to point out under-confident words in your speech so you get
						trained vocally, realtime.
					</li><br />
					<li>
						A flash-card type memory game that helps you with remembering types of genders and how they are
						represented.
