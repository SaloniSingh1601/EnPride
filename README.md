<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A chrome extension for
						
- women + non-binary => that suggests you a stronger, and much more confident lingo that
		makes you aware of how subconsciously you're trying to undermine yourself through your
			words.
							
- men => that suggests you a softer, much more inclusive lingo, so you do not offend any
				community member
					
- An onsite speech-to-text facility to point out under-confident words in your speech so you get
				trained vocally, realtime.
					
- A flash-card type memory game that helps you with remembering types of genders and how they are
						represented.


### Built With

We build our backend using the following technologies:
* Javascript
* Voice API

The frontend involves basic web development using Bootstrap, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may set up the project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.


Assuming you have Ananconda or Miniconda3 already working, create a tensorflow conda environment and then we're ready to go.

* Install the current release of CPU-only TensorFlow, recommended for beginners:


* Cd into your newly created environment (from command line or terminal)
```
bash cd C:\...\path-to-your-conda-environment\
```

## Running the code

* Fork and clone the project.

```
bash git clone https://github.com/akshitadixit/RAKSHA
```
* Cd into your cloned repo (folder with the same name as the repo on your system)
```
bash  cd C:\...\path-to-your-cloned-repo\
	
``` 

- Start with index.html
